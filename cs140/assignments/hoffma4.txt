For installing Ruby, because I am running it on my own laptop and
not through bobby, I checked on my command line by doing ruby -v to check my
version since I already had it installed. I came to find my version was at
1.87(came pre installed on macbook), and I just installed ruby 2.4 using
homebrew through tutorials I found on google. I also installed it on my
old mac book running ubuntu 16, using "sudo apt-get install ruby-full"
I didnt see that it was a requirement to use bobby, but I may have missed this.
I currently use github to store my files on the cloud as a back up. If Bobby is
a must, just let me know in a comment on the grade.

The only require step to begin creating a ruby program is to name the file
“Filename.rb” which tells the computer that this is a ruby file. To compile
and run the program, I would type ruby Filename.rb, which will compile and run
the current file I asked the computer to run. For this typing IRB allows for
immediate answers to be printed rather than compiling.



1. 11

2. 11.0 type float

3. No implicit conversion because you cant add type sting to type int. Logically does not make since, “syntax error”

4. Jim2017, it makes logical since, its adding 2 strings together, essentially creating one long type string object.

5. 4

6. Printed nothing, since you are using an if statement. The if statement of
(5 < 3) will never be found true, and thus the computer will not complete it

7. 4, unless works similarly to the if statement except the opposite.
It will print the statement no matter what, if and only if the logic following
the unless statement is found to be true, in which case it will not print
