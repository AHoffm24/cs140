Abstract Data Type in ruby notes
Data    operation
input -> Method -> output

What is an abstract datatype
ADT - User defined data structure and it has 2 parts to it
1. It seperates the logical interface or the behavior of this structure from
its concrete implementation
2. Ties together both data values and operations that are associated with those
values
example of care
Data:
engine
make
model
year
Operation:
drive
refuel
park

Defining Classes in ruby:
Concrete representation of an ADT in a program

Syntax
class ClassName - Class name must be capitalized 
    data = variables
    operations = methods *methods are a function in a class
end

variables are called instance variables. Want them to be accessible
everywhere in class.
@ = prepending before a variable name
now speed in both methods are the same variable
car.rb
class Car
  def drive
    @speed = 50
  end
  def park
    @speed = 0
  end
end
